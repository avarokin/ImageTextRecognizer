# ImageTextRecognition

I wanted to learn how to make applications for mobile platforms, since that is probably the best way to reach the largest audience in the modern world. Having never truly tried app development, I decided to dip my feet into an easy project and make an Android application to parse text from images.

My initial motivation was to be able to edit the text in pdf documents, and to do that I used Google's Vision API and learnt my way around Android Studio to create an application that could do just that. Since working on this gave me a hands on experience of developing for Android, I am now workin on making a chat application for mobile devices.
